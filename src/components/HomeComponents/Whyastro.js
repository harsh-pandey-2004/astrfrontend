          Cosmic Influences: How Planets Shape Our Lives{" "}
        </h1>
        <p className=" px-4 text-justify sm:px-12 mt-3">
          Astrology delves into the influence of cosmic bodies, primarily stars
          and planets, on human lives. While we recognize eight planets in our
          solar system, astrology acknowledges nine celestial entities, known as
          the Navagrahas. Interestingly, Earth is not included among these
          nine.In a world where uncertainty is a constant, astrology serves as a
          tool for navigating life’s complexities, helping individuals align
          with their true purpose and understand the divine orchestration at
          play.

          The Mystical Power of the Navagrahas
        </h1>
        <p className=" px-4 text-justify sm:px-12 mt-3">
          The nine planets in astrology are:
          <span className="text-yellow-600  ">Sun</span> (Surya),
          <span className="text-yellow-600  ">Moon</span> (Chandra),
          <span className="text-yellow-600">Mars</span> (Mangala),
          <span className="text-yellow-600">Mercury</span>(Budha),
          <span className="text-yellow-600">Jupiter</span> (Brihaspati),
          <span className="text-yellow-600">Venus</span> (Shukra),
          <span className="text-yellow-600">Venus</span> (Shani),
          <span className="text-yellow-600">Rahu</span> (North Node of the
          Moon),
          <span className="text-yellow-600">Ketu</span> (South Node of the
          Moon).
        </p>
        <p className=" px-4 text-justify sm:px-12 mt-3">
          These planets exert varying influences on our lives. Some, like
          Jupiter and Venus, are often considered beneficial, while others, such
          as Rahu and Ketu, might bring challenges. However, the impact of each
          planet is nuanced, depending on their positions in the twelve houses
          of one’s Kundli (birth chart).
