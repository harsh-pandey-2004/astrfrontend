            Ascendant is one of the most sought concepts in astrology when it comes to predicting the minute events in your life. At the time of birth, the sign that rises in the sky is the person's ascendant. It helps in making predictions about the minute events, unlike your Moon or Sun sign that help in making weekly, monthly, or yearly predictions for you.

            Your ascendant is Taurus.
