        Rudraksha beads are produced by the 'Rudraksha Tree' scientifically called Elaeocarpus. The tree grows at a certain altitude in the mountains, especially the Himalayas - the home to Lord Shiva. The seeds are known to have very unique vibrations that aid the spiritual and physical growth of the wearer. In Hindu scriptures, it is mentioned that the one who wears Rudraksha is blessed with the virtues of Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. Wearing Rudraksha, in fact, allows the wearer to connect with Lord Shiva and his divine energies.

        It is a belief that the wearer of Rudraksha not only pleases Lord Shiva but also Goddess Durga, Lord Indra, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Ganesh, Lord Kartikeya, Lord Aditya, and many other deities. If you want to condemn your sins or faults and purify your life, a Rudraksha is a good tool to begin with. It is said that a person’s sins burn down to ashes by merely looking at a Rudraksha. On the other hand, wearing a Rudraksha helps in the fulfilment of the desires of the wearer.

        The number of faces a Rudraksha has varies from 1-Mukhi to 21-Mukhi, all of which are used for different purposes. Henceforth, it is not advisable to buy any Rudraksha of your choice, wear it, and expect it to work. In fact, wearing the wrong Rudraksha can disturb a native’s life by exposing him to wrong energies or simply overpowering a certain planet or leaving it strengthless. Therefore, it is very important that you get a consultation from an astrologer to astrologically decide the most suitable Rudraksha for yourself.
