          Step 1 is the early on step. So in step 1 of learning how to peruse
          your kundli, we are going to learn about planets and houses in
          astrology as they are the soul and heart of any kundli along with
          signs in the kundli. Each planet and house in astrology signifies
          something or other. They carry particular characteristics, which may
          have either positive or negative effects on the native. In astrology,
          planets, signs, and houses do not work in isolation; they are all
          interdependent and contribute to bringing about changes in a person's
          life.

            Now that we have learned about the 9 planets in astrology and their
            meanings, we should look at the 12 signs in astrology. Signs, planets,
            and houses in astrology share a close relationship. Each zodiac sign
            is ruled by a planet, and thus, the planet brings its characteristics
            to the sign. For example, the zodiac sign Taurus is ruled by Venus.
            Venus characteristics (as mentioned above), such as love and relationship,
            make Taurus natives romantic and sensual. Signs in astrology have much
            more to offer when it comes to learning how to read a kundli. However,
            we will learn that in another lesson.

            Have you seen those kundli charts or diagrams, which really look
            like some kind of rocket science to decipher? The chart, also
            known as a birth chart, is composed of 12 different segments,
            also called Houses. Each house represents different aspects of
            a personâ€™s life. Let's take a quick look at these houses and
